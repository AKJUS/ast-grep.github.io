# Cpp

This page curates a list of example ast-grep rules to check and to rewrite Cpp code.

:::tip Reuse Cpp rules with C
Cpp is a superset of C, so you can reuse Cpp rules with C code. The [`languageGlobs`](/reference/sgconfig.html#languageglobs) option can force ast-grep to parse `.c` files as Cpp.
