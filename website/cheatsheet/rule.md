# Rule Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet provides a concise overview of ast-grep's rule object configuration, covering Atomic, Relational, and Composite rules, along with notes on Utility rules. It's designed as a handy reference for common usage.

## Atomic Rules Cheat Sheet

These are your precision tools, matching individual AST nodes based on their inherent properties.

<CheatSheet title="⚛️ Atomic Rules" variant="danger">

<Item>

```yaml
pattern: console.log($ARG)
```

🧩 Match a node by code structure. e.g. `console.log` call with a single `$ARG`

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
pattern:
  context: "{ key: value }"
  selector: pair
```

🧩 To parse ambiguous patterns, use `context` and specify `selector` AST to search.

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
kind: if_statement
```

🏷️ Match an AST node by its `kind` name
</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
regex: ^regex.+$
```

🔍 Matches node text content against a [Rust regular expression](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/)

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
nthChild: 1
```

🔢 Find a node by its **1-based index** among its _named siblings_

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
nthChild:
  position: 2
  reverse: true
  ofRule: { kind: argument_list }
```

🔢 Advanced positional control: `position`, `reverse` (count from end), or filter siblings using `ofRule`

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
range:
  start: { line: 0, column: 0 }
  end: { line: 0, column: 13 }
```

🎯 Matches a node based on its character span: 0-based, inclusive start, exclusive end

</Item>

## Relational Rules Cheat Sheet

These powerful rules define how nodes relate to each other structurally. Think of them as your AST GPS!

<CheatSheet title="🔗 Relational Rules" variant="warning">

<Item>

```yaml
inside:
  kind: function_declaration
```

🏠 Target node must appear **inside** its _parent/ancestor_ node matching the sub-rule

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
has:
  kind: method_definition
```

🌳 Target node must **have** a _child/descendant_ node matching the sub-rule

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
has:
  kind: statement_block
  field: body
```

🌳 `field` makes `has`/`inside` match nodes by their [semantic role](/advanced/core-concepts.html#kind-vs-field)

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
precedes:
  pattern: function $FUNC() { $$ }
```

◀️ Target node must appear _before_ another node matching the sub-rule

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
follows:
  pattern: let x = 10;
```

▶️ Target node must appear _after_ another node matching the sub-rule.

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
inside:
  kind: function_declaration
  stopBy: end
```

🏠 `stopBy` makes relational rules search all the way to the end, not just immediate neighbors.

</Item>

</CheatSheet>

## Composite Rules Cheat Sheet

Combine multiple rules using Boolean logic. Crucially, these operations apply to a single target node!

<CheatSheet title="🧠 Composite Rules" variant="tip">

<Item>

```yaml
all:
  - pattern: const $VAR = $VALUE
  - has: { kind: string_literal }
```

✅ Node must satisfy **ALL** the rules in the list.

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
any:
  - pattern: let $X = $Y
  - pattern: const $X = $Y
```

🧡 Node must satisfy **AT LEAST ONE** of the rules in the list.

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
not:
  pattern: console.log($$)
```

🚫 Node must **NOT** satisfy the specified sub-rule.

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
matches: is-function-call
```

🔄 Matches the node if that utility rule matches it. Your gateway to modularity!

</Item>

</CheatSheet>

## Utility Rules Cheat Sheet

Define reusable rule definitions to cut down on duplication and build complex, maintainable rule sets.

<CheatSheet title="📦 Utility Rules" variant="info">

<Item>

```yaml
rules:
  - id: find-my-pattern
    rule:
      matches: my-local-check
utils:
  my-local-check:
    kind: identifier
    regex: "^my"
```

🏡 Defined within the `utils` field of your current config file. Only accessible within that file.

</Item>

<Item>

```yaml
# In utils/my-global-check.yml
id: my-global-check
language: javascript
rule:
  kind: variable_declarator
  has:
    kind: number_literal
```

🌍 Defined in separate YAML files in global `utilsDirs` folders, accessible across your entire project.
